I am a computer science student at Dankook University and a contract software engineer at Toss Securities.

I created this application to help people enhance their note-taking skills. From my experience, simply switching applications doesn't lead to better notes. Consistent, easily revisable notes that don't negatively impact other note require deep thinking. So, why not share best practices for note-taking instead of figuring it all out on our own? This question led me to create a community dedicated to note-taking. I acknowledge that our product isn't perfect, especially in terms of design, but we are continuously working to improve it. Your advice and criticism are welcome.
